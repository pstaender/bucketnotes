## Server requirements

You can host the dist folder (see below how to build) as static files with any webserver. Of couse you need also a S3 bucket. 

## Setup S3 Bucket in AWS

You can setup a S3 bucket via [aws cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) by simply uploading the yaml-file below.

The example cloudformation-file does:

  * creates a S3 bucket with
    * versioning enabled
    * permissive CORS settings
    * R+W+D permissions
  * creates a programmatic user access (api access-token with secret), the credentials will be shown in the `Outputs` tab. 

Change ``mybucketnotes` to your preferred bucket name:

```yaml

  BucketName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the S3 bucket

```

## Non-AWS providers

You can use other S3-compatible-providers (not tested, but endpoint URL is exchangable at the login).

Always ensure, that you have correct/permissive CORE policies in your S3 bucket, otherwise the direct client-side S3 api calls from the browser will not work.

## Costs

Depends on your S3 provider, file-sizes and overall usage/traffic. But I guess it's very hard to reach the 1 USD per month as a single user‚Ä¶

## Build

Clone the repo, ensure Node v18+ is available, then:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

## Development
