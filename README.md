# Welcome to Bucketnotes üëã

An editor which helps you to focus on just writing. Use your own S3 bucket for cheap, private and fast storage. Organize your notes in zettelkasten-style.

The app runs entirely in your browser. You can also use it offline. It does not require any additional server or database. It uses the S3 API to read and write files directly to your S3 bucket.

[üöÄ Use the app in your browser for free (you only need a S3 bucket)](https://pstaender.github.io/bucketnotes/)

## Features

  * minimalistic interface
  * auto-save
  * dark mode
  * offline mode (progressive web app)
  * responsive (works on desktop, mobile and tablet)
  * image upload to s3 and displaying images
  * different fixed-size fonts

  * writes and reads text files from any s3 bucket
  * supports versioning (if s3 versioning is enabled)
  * html and pdf to markdown import
  * requires no extra service than the s3 bucket
  * open source

## Server requirements

You can host the dist folder (see below how to build) as static files with any webserver. Of couse you need also a S3 bucket.

## Setup S3 Bucket in AWS

You can setup a S3 bucket via [aws cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) by simply uploading the yaml-file below.

The example cloudformation-file does:

  * creates a S3 bucket with
    * versioning enabled
    * permissive CORS settings
    * R+W+D permissions
  * creates a programmatic user access (api access-token with secret), the credentials will be shown in the `Outputs` tab.

Change `my-example-bucket` to your preferred bucket name:

```yaml
Parameters:
  BucketName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the S3 bucket
    Default: my-example-bucket
Resources:

    Properties:
      UserName: !Ref S3User

    Value: !Ref 'S3Bucket'
    Description: Name of the Amazon S3 bucket.
  S3BucketSecureURL:
    Value: !Join ['', ['https://', !GetAtt [S3Bucket, DomainName]]]
    Description: Domain Name of the Amazon S3 bucket

    Value: !Ref S3UserAccessKey
  SecretAccessKey:
    Value: !GetAtt S3UserAccessKey.SecretAccessKey
  User:
    Value: !Ref S3User
```

## Non-AWS providers

You can use other S3-compatible-providers (not tested, but endpoint URL is exchangable at the login).

Always ensure, that you have correct/permissive CORS policies in your S3 bucket, otherwise the direct client-side S3 api calls from the browser will not work.

## Security and Privacy

Yes, by default the credentials (except the secret key) are stored in the browser's local storage. The secret-key can be stored - see checkbox `Remember Secret` at the login. This is a trade-off for simplicity and ease of use. If you are concerned about security, host the project under a custom domain or uncheck `Remember credentials` and `Remember secret` at the login.

## Costs

Depends on your S3 provider, file-sizes and overall usage/traffic. But I guess it's hard to reach the 1 USD per month as a single user - even with versioning enabled :)

## Build

Clone the repo, ensure Node v20+ is available, then:

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ npm run build
```

## Development

```sh
$ npm run develop
```
