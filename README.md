# Welcome to Bucketnotes ðŸ‘‹

An editor which helps you to focus on just writing.

* writes and reads text files from any s3 bucket
* supports versioning (if s3 versioning is enabled)
* built-in OCR (via tesseract+wasm)
* html and pdf to markdown import
* progressive web app (means: you can do offline writing)
* requires no extra service than the s3 bucket
* open source

If you like the concept, give it a try :)

## Setup AWS S3 Bucket

You can easily setup a s3 bucket via cloudformation.

This example has versioning enabled, permissive CORS settings, R+W+D permissions and includes an api-access-token. Change `BucketName.Default` to your preferred name:

```yaml
Parameters:
  BucketName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the S3 bucket
    Default: mybucketnotes
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Ref BucketName
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      CorsConfiguration:
        CorsRules:
          - AllowedHeaders:
              - '*'
            AllowedMethods:
              - GET
              - PUT
              - POST
              - DELETE
              - HEAD
            AllowedOrigins:
              - '*'
            Id: allowAllCors
            MaxAge: 3600
  S3User:
      Type: AWS::IAM::User
      Properties:
        Policies:
          - PolicyName: bucket-access
            PolicyDocument:
              Version: '2012-10-17'
              Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action:
                - s3:*
                Resource:
                  - !Sub arn:aws:s3:::${S3Bucket}
                  - !Sub arn:aws:s3:::${S3Bucket}/*
  S3UserAccessKey:
    Type: AWS::IAM::AccessKey
    Properties:
      UserName: !Ref S3User
Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Value: !Ref 'S3Bucket'
    Description: Name of the Amazon S3 bucket.
  S3BucketSecureURL:
    Value: !Join ['', ['https://', !GetAtt [S3Bucket, DomainName]]]
    Description: Domain Name of the Amazon S3 bucket
  AccessKeyID:
    Value: !Ref S3UserAccessKey
  SecretAccessKey:
    Value: !GetAtt S3UserAccessKey.SecretAccessKey
  User:
    Value: !Ref S3User
```

You should also be able to use other S3 providers (not tested, but endpoint URL is exhangable in the login).

Always ensure, that you have correct (permissive) CORE policies in your S3 bucket, otherwise the direct client-side S3 api calls from the browser will not work.

## Costs

Depending on your S3 provider, file sizes and overall usage (reading + writing). But I guess it's very hard to come close to the 1 USD per month as single user.

## Build

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

## Development

```sh
