## Server requirements

You can host the dist folder (see below how to build) as static files with any webserver. Of couse you need also a S3 bucket.

## Setup S3 Bucket in AWS

You can setup a S3 bucket via [aws cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) by simply uploading the yaml-file below.

The example cloudformation-file does:

  * creates a S3 bucket with
    * versioning enabled
    * permissive CORS settings
    * R+W+D permissions
  * creates a programmatic user access (api access-token with secret), the credentials will be shown in the `Outputs` tab.

Change `my-example-bucket` to your preferred bucket name:

```yaml
Parameters:
  BucketName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name of the S3 bucket
    Default: my-example-bucket
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Ref BucketName
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      CorsConfiguration:
        CorsRules:
          - AllowedHeaders:
              - '*'
            AllowedMethods:
              - GET
              - PUT
              - POST
              - DELETE
              - HEAD
            AllowedOrigins:
              - '*'
            Id: allowAllCors
            MaxAge: 3600
  S3User:
      Type: AWS::IAM::User
      Properties:
        Policies:

              Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action:
                - s3:*
                Resource:
                  - !Sub arn:aws:s3:::${S3Bucket}
                  - !Sub arn:aws:s3:::${S3Bucket}/*
  S3UserAccessKey:
    Type: AWS::IAM::AccessKey
    Properties:
      UserName: !Ref S3User
Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Value: !Ref 'S3Bucket'
    Description: Name of the Amazon S3 bucket.
  S3BucketSecureURL:
    Value: !Join ['', ['https://', !GetAtt [S3Bucket, DomainName]]]
    Description: Domain Name of the Amazon S3 bucket
  AccessKeyID:
    Value: !Ref S3UserAccessKey
  SecretAccessKey:
    Value: !GetAtt S3UserAccessKey.SecretAccessKey
  User:
    Value: !Ref S3User
```

## Non-AWS providers

You can use other S3-compatible-providers (not tested, but endpoint URL is exchangable at the login).

Always ensure, that you have correct/permissive CORS policies in your S3 bucket, otherwise the direct client-side S3 api calls from the browser will not work.

## Security and Privacy

Yes, by default the credentials (except the secret key) are stored in the browser's local storage. The secret-key can be stored - see checkbox `Remember Secret` at the login. This is a trade-off for simplicity and ease of use. If you are concerned about security, host the project under a custom domain or uncheck `Remember credentials` and `Remember secret` at the login.

## Costs

Depends on your S3 provider, file-sizes and overall usage/traffic. But I guess it's hard to reach the 1 USD per month as a single user - even with versioning enabled :)

## TODOs

* support deeper subfolders
* listing images
* make image folder configurable?
* encrypt aws credentials with local password instead of storing them in local storage

## Build

Clone the repo, ensure Node v20+ is available, then:

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ npm run build
```

## Development

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
